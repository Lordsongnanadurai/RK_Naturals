Chakras are spiritual power centers in our bodies. There are seven chakras which are Mooladhara, Swadhishtana, manipura, anahata, vishuddhi, anja, sahasrara. 
Chakra Mindfulness is the practice of bringing attention to these spiritual power centers. By doing this, life forces' storage, balance and distribution to the physical body along the subtle body are improved. 
Any single chakra or all blocked chakra can cause gradual dysfunction in the chakra's health. Chakra mindfulness helps to remove blockages and improve health.
