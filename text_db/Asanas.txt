Asanas are the practice of postures with awareness of breathing and have the benefit of revitalizing both the physical body and mind. Practising asanas means all the muscles and joints are stretched and relaxed, which can improve blood circulation to all body parts, thereby promoting better metabolic function and elimination. Hence, revitalization happens as a core benefit of practising asanas.
