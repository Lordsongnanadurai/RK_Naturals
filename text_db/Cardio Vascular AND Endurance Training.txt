Cardiovascular Endurance training is an important component determining the physical fitness of an individual, directly reflecting the strength and capacity of the heart. This kind of specialized exercise training helps to increase the bodys utilization of oxygenated blood in the tissues. We at RK Nature Cure Home teach this in varied modules like:

 Low intensity, Low Duration workouts
 Medium intensity, Medium duration workouts

In addition, cardiovascular exercise strengthens the heart, allowing more blood to be pumped out with each beat so that the heart does not have to beat as fast or work as hard.
