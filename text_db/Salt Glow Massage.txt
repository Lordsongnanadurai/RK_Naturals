Salt glow massage is a salt scrub in which pure coconut oil and salt are applied therapeutically all over the body or to the specific areas the doctor prescribes to derive the necessary effects. The gentle massage and smooth abrasive movements help to promote exfoliation and relaxation by improving circulation.
