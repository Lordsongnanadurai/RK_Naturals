Rehabilitation is a supportive process for a person who has suffered injury or illness and helps to restore lost skills, thereby effectively regaining maximum self- sufficiency. The three main types of rehabilitation exercise include occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech therapy. Each form of rehabilitation serves a unique purpose in helping a person maximize optimal recovery. This practice is significant in helping the patient return to a healthy lifestyle and rebuilding social happiness for the family and community.
