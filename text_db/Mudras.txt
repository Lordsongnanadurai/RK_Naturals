The Mudras are energy practices in Yoga. They are easy to do and give very powerful benefits. Mudras mean a gesture or seal in Sanskrit. They are helpful in various ways, as each mudra is designed to create an improved flow of pranic energy when done with proper guidance and breathing. The regulation of pranic energy helps immensely in healing acute and chronic illnesses and improving health.
